name = Extended Path Aliases
description = Automatically extend path aliases to include tabs, like <em>about-us/edit</em> for <em>node/123/edit</em>. Allow these aliases to be entered in page specification wild-cards, <em>about-us*</em>, e.g for block visibility.
core = 7.x
configure = admin/config/system/path_alias_xt
; While you will need to enable the core Path module to enter aliases,
; programmatically path_alias_xt has no dependency on it. Existing aliases
; will continue to be auto-extended, even if Path is disabled later on.
