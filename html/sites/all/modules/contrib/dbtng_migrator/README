=== About ===
This module is a UI and Drush interface to replicate a database from one 
database to another independant of what kind of database server they are. So 
long as there is support by Drupal, you can migrate to them, including non-SQL 
stuff!

== Support ==
DBTNG Migrator will work between all Core supported database drivers: MySQL,
PostgreSQL and SQLite. Experimental and contributed drivers may work but have
not been fully tested with DBTNG Migrator. These include Oracle, SQL Server
couchDB and MongoDB. 

DBTNG Migrator does not use any database or SQL specific configuration so 
theoretically any failures are due to other problems with either Drupal core
or the DBTNG drivers in use.

== Usage ==
1. Install the module like you would any other module.
2. The database you want to migrate from and too must be clearly defined in 
   the sites setttings.php file usually found in sites/default/settings.php.
   e.g.
    $databases = array (
      'default' => array (
        'default' =>
          array (
            'database' => 'sites/default/files/.ht.sqlite',
            'driver' => 'sqlite',
            'prefix' =>'',
          ),
      ),
      'dest' => array (
        'default' =>
          array (
            'database' => 'db',
              'username' => 'dbu',
              'password' => 'dbp',
              'host' => 'localhost',
              'port' =>'',
              'driver' => 'mysql',
              'prefix' =>'',
            ),
        ),
    );
3. You can migrate the database using one of two interfaces to the module. Through
   Drupal's web UI or using Drush. What you're more comfortable with. If you have
   a low php memory limit through the web UI you may want to consider using Drush
   instead. The web UI can be found at admin/structure/dbtng/migrator.
4. Use admin/structure/dbtng/migrator/check to check that the source database schema
   reflects the schema that Drupal knows about. This is crutial to ensure DBTNG
   Migrator doesn't error during migration because of a schema inconsistancy.
5. Web UI: With the settings.php file correctly configured, select the source 
   connection and the destination connection to migrate to. DBTNG Migrator with 
   migrate the schema and data from the source connection to the destination 
   connection.
   Drush: drush dbtng-replicate <source> <dest>
    e.g. drush dbtng-replicate default dest # From $database example in #2.
6. All going well, DBTNG Migrator will use a batch process to migrate your data
   from one database to another.
