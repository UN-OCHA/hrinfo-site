-- SUMMARY --

The Simple hierarchical select module displays selected taxonomy fields as
hierarchical selects on node creation/edit forms and as exposed filter in views.


-- REQUIREMENTS --

Taxonomy module (Drupal core) needs to be enabled.


-- INSTALLATION --

* Install as usual, see http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7
  for further information.


-- CONFIGURATION --

* Create a new field (type "Term reference") and select
  "Simple hierarchical select" as widget type.

* Field settings
  - "Allow creating new terms"
    Terms may be created directly from within the dropdowns (user needs to have
    permission to create terms in the vocabulary).
  - "Allow creating new levels"
    If selected users with permission to create terms in the vocabulary will be
    able to create a new term as child of the currently selected term.
  - "Force selection of deepest level"
    Force users to select terms from the deepest level.

* Views (exposed filter)
  - add a new filter using the field set-up as "Simple hierarchical select" or
    use "Content: Has taxonomy terms (with depth; Simple hierarchical select)"
    as a new filter
  - use "Simple hierarchical select" as selection type
  - select "Expose this filter to visitors, to allow them to change it"
  - enjoy :)


-- INTEGRATION WITH OTHER MODULES --

* Chosen (http://drupal.org/project/chosen)
  - If you have installed the module "Chosen" (>= 7.x-2.x) all elements of
    "Simple hierarchical select" are modified, so the user can search for items
    within the list. See http://drupal.org/project/chosen for more information.
  - If you have configured "Chosen" to apply always but do not want to apply it
    to the dropdowns created by "Simple hierarchical select" you may use the
    following CSS selector in the "Chosen" configuration:
    <code>select:visible:not(.shs-select)</code>
  - Apart from that you can select whether to use chosen on a per-field base by
    setting the option "Output this field with Chosen" in the field
    configuration.
    - "let chosen decide"
      The field is modified by Chosen if it matches the Chosen configuration.
    - "always"
      The field is always modified by Chosen.
    - "never"
      The field is not modified by Chosen even if it matches the Chosen
      configuration.

* High-performance JavaScript callback handler (http://drupal.org/project/js)
  - If you have lots of terms and a huge hierarchy you could increase the
    performance of "Simple hierarchical select" by installing "JS". It routes
    all javascript callbacks needed by "Simple hierarchical select" through a
    custom handler to avoid loading of all Drupal functions and speed up
    loading.

* Entity reference (https://www.drupal.org/project/entityreference)
  - "Simple hierarchical select" works out of the box with simple entity
    reference fields. In case you use Views as entity selection mode for your
    field there may be some problems, though.
    Your reference view needs at least one filter for the vocabulary. Otherwise
    "Simple hierarchical select" has no chance to retrieve the list of possible
    options to display.
    More complex reference views may cause "Simple hierarchical select" to fail,
    so its best to keep it as simple as possible.
