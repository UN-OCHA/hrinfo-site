Context OG for Context 3.x for Drupal 6.x
-----------------------------------------
Context OG provides some Organic Groups related conditions and reactions
for Context.  If you are already familiar with the Context module and its
conditions and reactions then this module should help you fill in the missing
pieces in regards to Organic Groups.

Installation
------------
1. Context can be installed like any other Drupal module -- place it in
the modules directory for your site and enable it.

2. Currently you must clear all caches (the button on the
admin/settings/performance screen is one way to do it) in order to
see the new conditions and reactions that are provided by this module.
