Search API Saved Searches
-------------------------

This module offers users the ability to save searches executed with the
Search API module and be notified of new results. Notifications are done
via mails with token-replacement, their frequency can be configured both by
admins and/or users and saved searches can also be created without first
executing the search.

Facet, Views or other filters set for the search will also be included in a
saved search, thus reflecting exactly the same search results as displayed.
