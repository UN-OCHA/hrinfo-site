SECURE LOGIN MODULE INSTALLATION
--------------------------------

1. Ensure the HTTPS version of your site works. Note: In certain server
   environments, you may need to set PHP's $_SERVER['HTTPS'] variable to "on"
   when the site is accessed via HTTPS (either in your webserver configuration
   or in your settings.php file).
2. Untar the module into your Drupal modules directory.
3. Read the README.txt before enabling the module and before upgrading!
4. Enable the module at admin/modules.
5. Configure the module at admin/config/people/securelogin.

SECURE LOGIN MODULE UNINSTALLATION
----------------------------------

If you did not follow step 1 above, or you copied your Drupal site to a
local instance which does not have HTTPS enabled, you may not be able to
login to your Drupal site to disable Secure Login module normally.
Instead you will need to:

1. Delete the securelogin directory from your modules directory.
2. Truncate (delete all entries in) the cache_page database table or
   run drush cc all.
3. Clear your browser cache.
