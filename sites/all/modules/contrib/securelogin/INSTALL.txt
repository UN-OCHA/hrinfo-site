SECURE LOGIN MODULE INSTALLATION
--------------------------------

1. Ensure the HTTPS version of your site works. Note: In certain server
   environments, you may need to set PHP's $_SERVER['HTTPS'] variable to "on"
   when the site is accessed via HTTPS (either in your webserver configuration
   or in your settings.php file).
2. If you have set the $base_url variable in your settings.php file, ensure that
   the URL scheme matches the scheme used to access the site.  For example:
   if (isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']) && strtolower($_SERVER['HTTPS']) == 'on') {
     $base_url = 'https://www.example.org';
   }
   else {
     $base_url = 'http://www.example.org';
   }
3. Untar the module into your Drupal modules directory.
4. Read the README.txt before enabling the module and before upgrading!
5. Enable the module at admin/modules.
6. Configure the module at admin/config/people/securelogin.

SECURE LOGIN MODULE UNINSTALLATION
----------------------------------

If you did not follow step 1 above, or you copied your Drupal site to a
local instance which does not have HTTPS enabled, you may not be able to
login to your Drupal site to disable Secure Login module normally.
Instead you will need to:

1. Delete the securelogin directory from your modules directory.
2. Truncate (delete all entries in) the cache_page database table or
   run drush cc all.
3. Clear your browser cache.
