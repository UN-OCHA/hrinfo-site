# Humanitarian Response theme

## CSS

This project uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) 

The Sass files are in `assets/sass`

### To generate the CSS from the Sass use [Compass](http://compass-style.org/):

1. Install Compass & other theme dependencies (requires Ruby): `bundle`

2. Watch for changes to the Sass: `compass watch`

3. Commit the generated CSS files with your other changes (it is not built on deploy).
